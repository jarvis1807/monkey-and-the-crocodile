Once upon a time in the forest, there lived a mokey who resided on the tree which was on the banks of the river. 
In the river there lived a crocodile and his  wife.
After their friendship the monkey would regularly bring fruits for the crocodile and the crocodile would take it home.
After a few days the wife told to the corcodile that if these fruits are so nice then so would the monkey taste nice.
Then she gave him the idea of inviting the monkey over for lunch and would decide to kill and eat him.
The crocodile was shocked to hear his wife say this and did not agree to the plan.
But, the wife threatned the crocodile and the crocodile had no other option but to obey his wife.
So, the next day, the crocodile invited the monkey over for lunch. But, the monkey replied
that he couldn't breathe underwater. So, the crocodile agreed to give the monkey a ride on his back.
Once upon reaching there the wife welcomed the monkey and the monkey's suspicion started to grow. 
When the wife came to attack on the monkey the monkey started to reach for the surface of the river and quickly climbed upon a tree.
Then the crocodile came to the surface and apologised to the monkey but the  monkey did not forgive him because he was betrayed by his friend.
